// Command octo-desktop is octo's native desktop shell — and, while it runs, the
// single backend every other octo interface shares. It binds the fixed loopback
// port octo serve uses (127.0.0.1:8088), runs the same web server in-process,
// and points a Wails window at it, so the Svelte frontend and every /api and
// /ws handler are reused unchanged and the Web UI / VS Code / Obsidian / CLI all
// connect to this one instance. On top of the server it adds the native layer a
// browser can't reach — OS folder dialog, tray, launch-at-login, notifications —
// wired in through server.NativeBridge.
//
// Only one backend owns the port at a time: the app joins the profile-scoped
// serve.pid protocol (internal/serveproc) that `octo serve -d` uses, offering to take over
// a running daemon rather than fighting for the port.
//
// See dev-docs/desktop-hub-design.md and dev-docs/wails-desktop-design.md.
